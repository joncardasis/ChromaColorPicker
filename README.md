## Installation
### Cocoapods
```
pod 'ChromaColorPicker'
```
### Manually
Add all files from the ChromaColorPicker folder to your project.


## Examples
```Swift
let neatColorPicker = ChromaColorPicker(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
neatColorPicker.delegate = self //ChromaColorPickerDelegate
neatColorPicker.padding = 5
neatColorPicker.stroke = 3
neatColorPicker.hexLabel.textColor = UIColor.white

view.addSubview(neatColorPicker)
```

If the ChromaColorPicker or any of its properties are later updated after being added to a view, the `layout()` function should be called to update the view.

```Swift
let neatColorPicker = ChromaColorPicker(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
view.addSubview(neatColorPicker)

neatColorPicker.padding = 0
neatColorPicker.hexLabel.hidden = true

neatColorPicker.layout()
```

You can also set the color of the picker anytime by using the `adjustToColor(color:)` function.

```Swift
let neatColorPicker = ChromaColorPicker(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
...
neatColorPicker.adjustToColor(UIColor.green)
...
```
